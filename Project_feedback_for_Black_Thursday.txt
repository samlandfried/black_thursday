Dear Sam,

I loved working with you on this project. I appreciate your commitment to me as your partner and to this project, and I also appreciate you letting me drive so much so that I could gain the significant experience I took away from this project. It’s clear to me that you are very invested in overall team success and project experience.
	
Your strengths include:
- Super positive
- Flexible attitude
- Easy going
- Knowledgeable about various Ruby methods
- Creative in writing code
- Patient
- Communicative and open

Things you need to work on:
- Not a thing! I would have put TDD if we were at the beginning of the project, but you’re an old pro at it now.

Thanks for an excellent project/partner experience. I really hope we get to work together again!

Erin
