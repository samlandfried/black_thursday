It was a joy working with you! I appreciated your commitment to having a successful collaboration experience. Our daily retros helped us calibrate our shared time and project strategy, which was awesome and productive. I believe we spent virtually every minute of work time on this project together, which was a first for me. I value constructive feedback at moments like these, but I'm struggling to think of anything I think you could have done differently to improve our experience. As far as your personal development with code goes, I think you're making swift progress through new terrain, and it's clear that you're not limited by algorithmic thinking or any higher-order concepts. The walls you hit always seemed to be about syntax issues and Ruby functionality, and those will recede as you continue engaging the language. So I guess my only advice for the future is keep on trucking! I look forward to working with you on future projects.
